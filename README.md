# Desafio1 - ONE
Challenge 1 - ONE

This is my very first project done in HTML, CSS and JS. It was done while i was learning to code with these languages. This project was done as part of a course for learn programming (ONE - Alura)

This program is composed of a codificator/decodificator, all done in HTML, CSS and JS.

First - Type some message you want to codificate and click in "CODIFICAR"
Second - The message will appear in the side textarea already codificated. In this area there is also a copy button (COPIAR), where you may click to copy the codificated content to yout clipboard.
Third, with the codificated content, you can paste it in the main textarea and click in "DECODIFICAR", and than, in the side textarea, the text will appear decodificated.

This site is also suposed to be responsive to others displays sizes.
